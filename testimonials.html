      "The behind the scenes processes with Escrow Professional Co. is one of
      a kind. The true testimony of all great businesses is how they handle the
      client after the transaction is complete. My previous mortgage holder
      paid my county taxes shortly after my home was sold. I contacted several
      people trying to get answers on how to receive my escrow funds back. At
      every turn there was someone telling me a different answer with zero
      ownership of the issue. Without an answer I contacted Marg at Escrow
      Professional Co. and was immediately treated like a valued customer. Within
      a minute of explaining my situation she informed me how the process works,
      gave me her direct number, and contacted the county office to find answers!
      Marg didn’t have to go above and beyond like she did, but I’ll never forget
      how that made me feel."

      "I have been in the mortgage industry for 19 years, and during that time 
      I have had the opportunity to work with many closing agents. Escrow 
      Professional Company is by far the best. They are professional, they are
      thorough, they can answer and assist in handling any title or other problem, 
      and they get things done. In our business it's extremely important to make
      sure you are making deadlines and getting HUD numbers out asap. Escrow 
      Professional Company delivers on that promise consistently through their 
      motivation to provide great service. Occasionally I have the opportunity 
      to work with other closing agents, and invariably things don't go smoothly, 
      there are delays and / or issues. The closing is the last thing our clients 
      experience about their loan process, and it is extremely important that part
      goes smoothly. I will use Escrow Professional at every opportunity. Their
      service and proven track record make them a perfect partner!"

      "You probably don’t remember closing our loan in June but we were the family 
      that hauled in our four children. You stayed late on a Friday so we could 
      close our loan and move into our new home. We appreciate the time you spent
      with us. We will always remember the joy we felt as we signed the papers while
      our daughters jumped up and down and clapped their hands with excitement
      because they were finally moving into their the new home."

      "I have been a realtor for over 15 years and throughout my career have had
      the opportunity to work with a number of escrow companies. Over the past 
      14 years I have had the pleasure of working with the Escrow Professional 
      Company on a variety of projects and have consistently found them to be
      dependable, reliable and professional. My interactions with them have been
      uniformly positive and I believe them to be the best Closing Company in the
      entire DSM area. In my interactions with them they have been able to get the
      most difficult seller/buyer transaction put together and done on time. If a
      problem arises they do whatever it takes to solve it without putting all the
      responsibility for resolving the issue back on the agent. They always
      provide me with the expertise and support I need in order to meet the needs
      of my clients in a qualitative and timely manner."
